# Code Reviews

Effective code reviews help improve code quality, share knowledge, and catch bugs early. Here are the main things to focus on during a code review:

## 1. Correctness

- Does the code do what it’s supposed to?
- Are edge cases and error handling covered?
- Are there any potential bugs or logic errors?

## 2. Readability

- Is the code easy to read and understand?
- Are variable, function, and class names meaningful?
- Is complex logic explained with comments or broken into smaller functions?

## 3. Style & Consistency

- Does the code follow project and language style guides?
- Is there consistent formatting (indentation, spacing, braces, etc.)?
- Are patterns and conventions used consistently?

## 4. Simplicity

- Is the solution as simple as possible?
- Is there unnecessary complexity or duplication?
- Can any part be refactored or made more concise?

## 5. Tests

- Are there sufficient automated tests for new features or bug fixes?
- Do tests cover edge cases and potential failures?
- Do all tests pass?

## 6. Security

- Are there any obvious security issues?
- Is user input validated and sanitized?
- Are secrets and sensitive data handled correctly?

## 7. Documentation

- Is the code adequately documented (comments, docstrings)?
- Are public APIs or functions explained?
- Is usage clear for other developers?

## 8. Performance

- Are there any potential performance bottlenecks?
- Is resource usage reasonable (memory, CPU, network)?
- Would this code scale if needed?

## 9. Dependencies

- Are dependencies necessary and up-to-date?
- Is third-party code used appropriately?
